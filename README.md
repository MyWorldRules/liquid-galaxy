# Liquid-Galaxy
Google Code-In 2017-2018, Liquid Galaxy Task by Tarun Ravi

## Liquid Galaxy installation on multiple nodes 

For this process, we will use the below three code artifacts
+ lg_install.sh - this is a wrapper script that calls the main script
+ Install.sh - is the main install script
+ machine_list.dat is the config file

We will start the installation process from the master node, logged in as user called lg and the below prerequisites have to be completed manually, to setup remote connectivity.

  a. sudo apt-get install openssh-server in all nodes
  b. ssh-keygen on the master node
  c. ssh-copy-id user@machine for each node, from master, to enable login without password
  d. add this line to /etc/sudoers file, for user(lg) to execute sudo without password
lg    ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

The configuration file(machine_list.dat) should be downloaded to the master computer, to its home directory and filled with below details - Machine IP address, machine_ID, lg_frame. This is the same format, as the example text already in said file. 

<aside class="warning">
IMPORTANT: There should not be any empty lines, and the master machine should be the last line.
</aside>

lg_install.sh has to be executed from the master computer, logged in as lg user. This script reads the machine info from the machine_list.dat file and for each machine, calls the main script - install.sh with the below 3 parameters - machine_ID, lg_frame, and total_machines.

The install process completes once the end of file has been reached.
